# Module 1 - Getting Started

## What are we doing

In this module we will begin our basic interactions with Python. We will work with a few concepts in the command line 

* Importing Modules
* Printing Data
* Accessing Environment Variables
* Simple Functions

## Importing Modules

Modules expose additional functionality to the basesline python capabilities. Virtually every method and function is accessed after importing a module. Take the following script block...

`import json
import os
import flask
import requests`

In this block we are importing several modules that ar commonly used. 

The `import json` block allows us to manipulate and create JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects (more on that later.

The`import os` is something we can use to read in Operating System environment variables and much more!

The `import flask` block references access a webframework known as flask. We will be covering this platform in a much later tutorial, but if you want to skip ahead, no one is stopping you :) (http://flask.pocoo.org/)

The `import rquests` block is one we will be using extnesively as it allows you to interact with http requests.
