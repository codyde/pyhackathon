# Module 1 - Getting Started

## What are we doing

In this module we will begin our basic interactions with Python. We will work with a few concepts in the command line 

* Importing Modules
* Printing Data
* Accessing Environment Variables
* Simple Functions

## Importing Modules

Modules expose additional functionality to the basesline python capabilities. Virtually every method and function is accessed after importing a module. Take the following script block...

`import json
import os
import flask
import requests`

In this block we are importing several modules that ar commonly used. the `import json` block allows us to manipulate and create JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects (more on that later).
